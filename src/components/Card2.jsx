          As a Junior Software Engineer at UTS, I enhanced the universityâ€™s website by resolving critical bugs and refining responsive UI components with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project ensured pixel-perfect alignment with Figma designs, boosting both student engagement and overall site performance.
